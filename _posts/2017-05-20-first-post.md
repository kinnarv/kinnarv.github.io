### Installing the Kotlin plugin

The Kotlin plugin is bundled with Android Studio starting from [version 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html). If you use an earlier version, you'll need to install the Kotlin plugin. Go to File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Install JetBrains plugin… and then search for and install Kotlin. If you are looking at the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen, choose Configure -> Plugins -> Install JetBrains plugin… You'll need to restart the IDE after this completes.
